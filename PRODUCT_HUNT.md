# MindClear - Product Hunt Launch Materials

## 🎯 Product Hunt Submission

### One-Liner (60 chars max)
**"AI turns mental chaos into 3 daily focus items"**

### Tagline (120 chars)
**"Stop juggling mental tasks. Dump your thoughts (text or voice), get AI clarity, focus on what matters today."**

### Description (Up to 260 words)

**The Problem:**
Your brain wasn't built to be a task manager. Every "I should..." thought takes up mental RAM. By noon, you're overwhelmed with a dozen mental tabs open, unsure what actually matters.

**The Solution:**
MindClear gives you cognitive relief through a simple 3-step process:

**1. Dump Everything**
Text or voice - pour out whatever's weighing on your mind. No organizing, no filtering. Just pure brain dump.

**2. AI Processes**
Claude AI reads your chaos and extracts what matters: tasks, commitments, deadlines. It separates actionable items from emotional noise (and acknowledges your stress).

**3. Get Your 3 Items**
Every morning, see exactly 3 focus items. Not 20. Not 50. Three. Done, park, or drop each one.

**Key Features:**
- Voice & text capture (hold-to-record makes it effortless)
- Context-aware AI (remembers what you already captured, no duplicates)
- Emotional acknowledgment (validates when you're venting vs. planning)
- Smart deadline detection (extracts "tomorrow" → actual dates)
- Daily 3-item limit (forces prioritization, prevents overwhelm)

**Built for:**
People drowning in mental tasks. Overwhelmed knowledge workers. Anyone who's ever thought "I have so much to do I don't know where to start."

**Tech:**
Next.js, Supabase, Claude AI (Anthropic), Deepgram voice transcription, beautiful glassmorphism UI.

Free to start. No credit card required.

Hey Product Hunt! 👋

I'm excited to launch MindClear - a tool I built because my brain kept trying to be a task manager (spoiler: it's terrible at it).

**The backstory:**
I'd wake up overwhelmed with a dozen mental tasks, unsure what actually mattered. Todo apps made it worse - I'd spend 30 minutes organizing tasks instead of doing them.

So I built MindClear with one core belief: **your brain should create, not organize.**

**How it works:**
1. Dump your mental chaos (text or voice)
2. AI extracts tasks, commitments, deadlines
3. Get exactly 3 focus items for today

That's it. No folders. No tags. No priority levels 1-5. Just 3 things that matter today.

**Cool AI features:**
- Separates venting from actual tasks (and validates your stress)
- Remembers context to avoid duplicates
- Extracts dates from natural language ("tomorrow", "next Friday")
- Suggests specific next steps for each item

**Built with:**
Next.js, Claude Sonnet 4.5, Deepgram for voice, Supabase. Took 7 days from idea to launch.

**Try it free** → [your-url]

I'd love feedback! What features would make this more useful for you?

### Twitter Thread

1/ Your brain wasn't built to be a task manager.

But every "I should..." thought occupies mental RAM.

By noon, you have 20 tabs open and no idea where to start.

I built something to fix this 🧵

2/ MindClear: dump your mental chaos, AI extracts what matters

No organizing. No tagging. No priority levels.

Just raw brain dump → clarity

3/ How it works:

Text or voice → Claude AI → 3 focus items

That's it. Not 20 items. Three.

4/ The AI is surprisingly good at:
- Knowing when you're venting vs. planning
- Extracting dates ("tomorrow" → actual date)
- Avoiding duplicates
- Suggesting specific next steps

5/ Launching on PH today. Free to try.

Your brain will thank you.

## 💡 FAQ Preparation

**Q: How is this different from todo apps?**
A: Todo apps make you organize. MindClear makes you dump. The AI does the organizing.

**Q: What if I have more than 3 things to do?**
A: You do. But you can only truly focus on 3 today. MindClear forces prioritization.

**Q: Is my data private?**
A: Yes. End-to-end encrypted, stored in Supabase. We don't train on your data.

**Q: How much does AI processing cost you?**
A: ~$0.02 per dump. Sustainable at scale with monetization.

**Q: Will there be a mobile app?**
A: Web-first for now. Mobile-optimized. Native app if there's demand.

**Q: What about offline mode?**
A: Not yet. AI processing requires connection. Future enhancement.

**Q: Can I export my data?**
A: Not yet in V1. Will add data export in next version.
